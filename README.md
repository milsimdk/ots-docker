# Docker setup for OpenTAKServer
--- 
Docker setup for [OpenTAKServer](https://github.com/brian7704/OpenTAKServer) (OTS) is yet another open source TAK Server for ATAK, iTAK, and WinTAK

### *****************************************************************
### NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION YET
### *****************************************************************

## First boot
```Shell
# Download / Pull
git clone git@github.com:milsimdk/ots-docker.git && cd ots-docker

# Start OTS
make up

# Check logs
make logs
```

WebUI is available on https://localhost

## Problems you can have
- [Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket](#docker-daemon-socket-denied)
- [Folder permissions](#folder-permissions)

### Docker daemon socket denied
```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### Folder permissions
If you get a `Permission denied` error it might because of folder permissions \
To fix it add your user id and group id in `compose.override.yaml`
```shell
id
cp compose.override.yaml-example compose.override.yaml

# Change line 4 so it matches your folder owner id and group id 
```


## Config changes 
You can change config options by using 'environment' in the compose.override.yaml file \
Options name must have the prefix `DOCKER_` or else they are ignored! \
You can overwrite all settings this way so watch out!!!

It's also possible to just change them in the `persistent/ots/config.yml` file
